# superpixPool
Superpixel Pooling implemented in PyTorch and Chainer

This is the product of a Masters thesis done by Mathijs Schuurmans under supervision by Maxim Berman and Matthew Blaschko, at the center for processing speech and images, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven. It includes CUDA implementation of superpixel pooling with integration in the Chainer and PyTorch deep learning framworks.
